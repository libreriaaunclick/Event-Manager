# Event Management System — Phase 1

A RESTful Event Management API built with Spring Boot 3.x as part of a progressive learning journey from monolith to microservices.

## About This Project

This is **Phase 1** of a 5-phase project designed to learn the entire Spring ecosystem by building a real application. Each phase adds new technologies on top of a working foundation.

| Phase | Focus | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Phase 1 | Core REST API — Spring Boot, JPA, H2, Lombok | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 2 | Persistence & Logic — MySQL, Flyway, Validation, MapStruct, JUnit | 🔜 Next |
| Phase 3 | Speed & Search — Redis, Elasticsearch, Swagger | 🔜 Planned |
| Phase 4 | Security — Spring Security, OAuth2, Spring AI | 🔜 Planned |
| Phase 5 | Cloud & Microservices — Docker, Kafka, GitHub Actions | 🔜 Planned |

## Architecture

This project follows a **3-tier layered architecture**:

```
HTTP Request
     ↓
Controller Layer     → receives HTTP, delegates to service
     ↓
Service Layer        → business logic, validates rules
     ↓
Repository Layer     → database operations via JPA
     ↓
H2 In-Memory DB
```

Exceptions thrown at any layer are caught by `GlobalExceptionHandler` and returned as clean JSON responses.

## API Endpoints

Base URL: `http://localhost:8080/api/events`

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Status Code |
|--------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/events` | Get all events | 200 OK |
| GET | `/api/events/{id}` | Get event by ID | 200 OK |
| POST | `/api/events` | Create new event | 201 Created |
| PUT | `/api/events/{id}` | Update existing event | 200 OK |
| DELETE | `/api/events/{id}` | Delete event | 204 No Content |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.x
- IntelliJ IDEA (recommended) or any IDE
- Postman (for API testing)

### Run the Application

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/event-management.git
cd event-management
```

**2. Build the project**
```bash
mvn clean install
```

**3. Run the application**
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application starts on `http://localhost:8080`

---

### H2 Database Console

While the app is running, visit the H2 web console to inspect your data live:

```
URL:      http://localhost:8080/h2-console
JDBC URL: jdbc:h2:mem:eventsdb
Username: sa
Password: (leave empty)
```

Run `SELECT * FROM events` to see all your data in real time.

> Note: H2 is an in-memory database. All data is lost when the application stops. This is replaced with MySQL in Phase 2.
